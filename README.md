This repository includes the files of the manuscript Systematic Solving Study for Optimization of the Multiperiod Blending Problem: A Multiple Mathematical Approach Solution Guide.

In this paper, six different approaches for the multiperiod blending problem are tested in terms of global optimality and computational time. The solution methods discussed are the standard MINLP formulation, the relaxation created using McCormick envelopes, a Radix-Based Discretization (RBD), a generalized disjunctive programming (GDP) formulation, a Redundant Constraint GDP formulation (RC-GDP) and a Two-Stage MILP-MINLP Decomposition (2 Stage Deco).
